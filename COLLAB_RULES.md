# General rules to ensure productivity:

This document includes general rules to avoid the lack of productivity we have seen in the past 6 weeks. Any member who wishes to collaborate must adhere to these rules or find something else to work on.

### 1- One commit per day:

At a minimum, a collaborator must at least contribute with 1 commit per day. A commit should be meaningful, meaning that while a collaborator doesn't have to finish an entire feature every day, although that would be ideal, they should at least **add some logic to the code**. Do not forget to keep the commits as **focused and granular** as possible.

### 2- One [WiP] pull request at any given time:

A collaborator must have one PR with a `[WiP]` status open at any given time. It is not acceptable to have less than one, and is also not acceptable to have more than one. Work must be focused, and therefore, each collaborator must work on one thing only at a time. When the feature is finished, the status changes to `awaiting review`, and another pull request may be open.
**Note:** A [WiP] PR is opened with the first commit on a branch.

### 3- PRs with the `awaiting review` label must take priority over current task:

In order to Maximize our efficiency and be able to accurately measure our progress and productivity, a PR that awaits review must be reviewed as soon as possible. A PR requires reviews from half the collaborators to be merged, however, all collaborator must review the PR within a maximum of 48 hours. This is essential to maximize our collective learning and to maximize our efficiency and ability to reflect on our progress and adapt our workflow accordingly.

### 4- Issues with the label `question` must take absolute priority:

An issue with the label `question` likely means that a collaborator's progress on a feature is blocked until the question is resolved. Therefore, when a question is opened, all collaborator must do what they can to ensure that the question is answered within 24 hours. Otherwise, we are likely to see massive dips in productivity without being able to pinpoint why or how to address it.

### 5- Check Acceptance Criteria before closing any PR.

A collaborator who opens a PR is ultimately responsible for the feature in question. However, all collaborator share responsibility to an extent for the quality of the project. Collaborator must make sure to go over the acceptance criteria of the issue related by a PR as they review it.

The collaborator who worked on the PR must manually check each box in the issue once the PR approved. This is not just procedure. This is giving them a last chance to think about the feature in light of the acceptance criteria and determine if its truly complete.

### 6- Collaborators must hold a weekly meeting to reflect on the progress made and decide how to move forward.
